<H1>Asian Credit Union Network Management Platform (CUNM)</H1>

<h2 style="color: #00b0f0;">PURPOSE:</h2>

<p>The adoption of effective know-your-members system is an essential part of risk management practices.  Inadequate information on the performance of an individual credit union and the overall credit union network may be subject to significant risks, especially on reputational risk.</p>

<p>CUNM seeks to maintain a real-time database of credit unions’ market sourced from more than 23,000 financial cooperatives in at least 25 countries in Asia. From individual credit union to their respective regulators, our member organizations use this information to gain a comprehensive view of Asian financial cooperatives’ market and its performance. CUNM ensures that secondary credit union organizations are able to manage the performance of their network using the information generated by the platform.  Thus, the federations are able to respond to the actual problem instead of just perceived needs.</p>

<p>Enabling the secondary level financial cooperative organizations and ACCU, as the regional organization know and analyze the performance of the network does not only contribute to the overall safety and soundness, they also protect the integrity of the financial cooperative system.</p>

<p>CUNM attempts to provide consolidated information on both select qualitative and quantitative information from the Financial Statements of Asian credit unions. Analysis derived from CUNM serve as warning signs on the current or looming threat to safety and soundness and reputational risks presented to the network.</p>

<p>The participation of the federations of credit unions is critical in meeting the desired outcome of CUNM.</p>
